# YOLOv8 Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains **6 YOLOv8-based computer vision projects**, each designed for **real-time detection and analysis**. All projects have **interactive Streamlit GUIs** for easy use.  

## Projects Overview

### 1️⃣ Brain Tumor Detection
- Detects tumors in MRI images.
- Highlights tumor regions with bounding boxes.
- **Input:** MRI images (`.jpg`, `.png`)

### 2️⃣ Counting People
- Counts the number of people entering through a defined line in video footage.
- Uses a **centroid-based tracker** to assign IDs and prevent double counting.
- **Input:** Entrance surveillance videos (`.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`)

### 3️⃣ Football Match Labeling
- Detects players, ball, and field zones in football match videos.
- Annotates video for analysis or coaching purposes.
- **Input:** Match videos (`.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`)

### 4️⃣ License Plate Detection
- Detects vehicle license plates in images.
- Crops and displays detected plates.
- **Input:** Vehicle images (`.jpg`, `.png`)

### 5️⃣ Money Recognition
- Detects and labels Egyptian currency notes in images.
- Highlights each detected note with its denomination.
- **Input:** Money images (`.jpg`, `.png`)

### 6️⃣ Parking Counter
- Detects free and occupied parking spaces in parking lot videos.
- Counts available and occupied spots in real-time.
- **Input:** Parking videos (`.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`)
